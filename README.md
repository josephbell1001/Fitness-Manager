# 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Manager

A simple desktop app I wrote in Java to create custom workout plans. I keep a library of exercises, bundle them into named training sessions (with set counts), and save/load everything to JSON. The UI is clean, fast, and simple to use.

## ✨ Features

- **Exercise Library**
  - Add exercises with: **name**, **target muscle**, **weight (lbs)**, **reps**.
  - Edit an exercise anytime.
  - Delete an exercise (with confirmation). Deleting also removes it from all sessions.

- **Training Sessions**
  - Create named sessions (e.g., *Arms*, *Push Day*).
  - Add exercises to a session with a **sets** count.
  - From the session page:
    - **+ Add Exercise** (header)
    - **✖ Remove Exercise** (header) — choose which one to remove
    - Per-row **Edit Exercise** (updates the library entry)

- **Persistence**
  - Save the whole program to `./data/fitness_manager.json`
  - Load it back with one click
  - “Programs Saved” metric increments each time I save

- **Activity & Metrics**
  - Recent Activity feed logs actions like create/edit/add/remove/save/load
  - Dashboard counters: **Total Exercises**, **Training Sessions**, **Programs Saved**

## 🚀 How I use it

1. **Create exercises** → Sidebar → *Create Exercise* → fill in → OK  
2. **Build a session** → Sidebar → *Create Training Session* → name it → add exercises with sets  
3. **Remove an exercise** → Open session → **✖ Remove Exercise** → pick exercise  
4. **Edit/Delete an exercise** → Open exercise detail → Edit or Delete  
5. **Save/Load** → Top bar or sidebar buttons
